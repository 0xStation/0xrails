# Mage ðŸ§™

_A Solidity framework for creating complex and evolving onchain structures._

Mage is an acronym for the architecture pattern's four layers: **Module**, **Access**, **Guard**, and **Extension**.

Mage's intuition began cultivating in mid-2021 in response to designing for modular token design and vault management problems.
Currently, Mage is being developed and applied in production for [GroupOS](https://groupos.xyz/), a protocol and product for creating autonomous networks.

### Helpful commands

Deploy [ERC721Mage](./src/cores/ERC721/ERC721Mage.sol) with:
```
forge create --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --verify --chain-id 5 --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL --api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY src/cores/ERC721/ERC721Mage.sol:ERC721Mage
```

## Contributing

While Mage is in initial R&D, assistance on reviews for security and developer experience are most appreciated. Upon first release, Mage will support public contributions and commentary and likely incorporate a token-incentive model for fun and recognition.

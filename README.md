# Mage ðŸ§™

_A Solidity framework for creating complex and evolving onchain structures._

Mage is an acronym for the architecture pattern's four layers: **Module**, **Access**, **Guard**, and **Extension**.

Mage's intuition began cultivating in mid-2021 in response to designing for modular token design and vault management problems.
Currently, Mage is being developed and applied in production for [GroupOS](https://groupos.xyz/), a protocol and product for creating autonomous networks.

## Contributing

While Mage is in initial R&D, assistance on reviews for security and developer experience are most appreciated. Upon first release, Mage will support public contributions and commentary and likely incorporate a token-incentive model for fun and recognition. In the meantime, please reach out directly via [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/ilikesymmetry).
